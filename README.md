# FireSpoof
Automate spoofing phone calls using the FireRTC service. You must have an account registered with https://firertc.com to use. Signing up is free, no worries!

# Description 
Will allow you to spoof bogus phone calls on the fly, and when the call ends it will automatically close the window for you. This program uses selenium in order to do most of the heavy lifting, I just wrote the script. 

I made this for Social-Engineering engagements (Note: I was given permission to legally test in all engagements) in which I needed to dial up a ton of people up pretty fast, sometimes with different numbers.
